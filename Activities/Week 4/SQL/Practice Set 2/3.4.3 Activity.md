## 3.4.2 Activity REVIEW



### Exercise 1: Matched Customer Orders

**Task:** Retrieve a list of customers (`c_name`) who have placed orders. Display the customer name along with the order date (`o_orderdate`).

If there are not matching line item then the count should be `0`. **Hint**: `COALESCE`

### Exercise 2: Customers Without Orders

**Task:** Identify all customers who haven't placed any orders. Display their names (`c_name`) and market segments (`c_mktsegment`).



### Exercise 3: Supplier and Nation Association

**Task:** For each supplier (`s_name`), retrieve the supplier's name and their associated nation's name (`n_name`). Include all suppliers, even if their nation is somehow missing in the dataset.



### Exercise 4: Customers and Their Regions

**Task:** Display a list of all customers (`c_name`) and their associated regions (`r_name`). If a customer's region cannot be determined, still display the customer's name but indicate the region as 'Unknown'.

HINT: Check out `COALESCE` 

Example: Try and see what it does `COALESCE(r.r_name, 'Unknown') AS region_name `

### Exercise 5: Products and Their Orders

**Task:** Retrieve a list of products (`p_name`) and the number of times they've been ordered (`o_orderkey`). Include all products, even if they haven't been ordered, and display a count of 0 for those.



HINT: Check out COALESCE 

Example: Try and see what it does  `COALESCE(COUNT(l.l_orderkey), 0) AS order_count`
