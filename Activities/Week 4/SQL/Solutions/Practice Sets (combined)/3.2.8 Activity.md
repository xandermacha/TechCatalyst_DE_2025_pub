## 3.2.8

1. Write a query that uses a function to alter the string `'cow it maked dende' `by changing all occurrences of **c** to **n**, and all occurrences of **d** to **s**.

```sql
SELECT 'COW IT MAKED DENDE'
```

solution

```sql
SELECT TRANSLATE('COW IT MAKED DENDE','CD','NS');
```



2. Write a query that returns the number of **days** between the dates `01-JAN-2024 `and `15-AUG-2025`.

```sql
SELECT DATEDIFF(DAY, '01-JAN-2024', '15-AUG-2025');
```



3. Update the query to convert the following into Decimal. Write three different variations: using `CAST`, `CONVERT`, and the `TO_DECIMAL` function

```sql
SELECT '15873.26'
```

solution 

```sql
SELECT CAST('15873.26' AS DECIMAL(7, 2)) AS TO_DEC_VAL;

SELECT CONVERT(DECIMAL(7, 2), '15873.26') AS TO_DEC_VAL;

SELECT TO_DECIMAL('$15,873.26','$99,999.99',7,2) AS TO_DEC_VAL;
```

4. Use `TO_DECIMAL` and `TRY_TO_DECIMAL` to update the following SQL to convert from STRING to DECIMAL. `GOOD` demonstrates a successful conversion, while BAD should represent unsuccessful conversion and hence it should show NULL as shown

```sql
SELECT '$15,873.26' AS GOOD,
         '$15,873.26' AS BAD
```

solution

```sql
SELECT TRY_TO_DECIMAL('$15,873.26','$99,999.99',7,2) AS GOOD,
         TRY_TO_DECIMAL('$15,873.26','999.9',4,2) AS BAD
```
