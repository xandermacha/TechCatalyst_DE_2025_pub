## 3.4.2 Activity REVIEW



### Exercise 1: Matched Customer Orders

**Task:** Retrieve a list of customers (`c_name`) who have placed orders. Display the customer name along with the order date (`o_orderdate`).

```sql

SELECT p.p_name, COALESCE(COUNT(l.l_orderkey), 0) AS order_count
FROM part AS p
LEFT JOIN lineitem AS l ON p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
GROUP BY p.p_name;

```



### Exercise 2: Customers Without Orders

**Task:** Identify all customers who haven't placed any orders. Display their names (`c_name`) and market segments (`c_mktsegment`).

```sql
SELECT c.c_name, c.c_mktsegment
FROM customer AS c
LEFT JOIN orders AS o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
WHERE o.o_orderkey IS NULL;
```



### Exercise 3: Supplier and Nation Association

**Task:** For each supplier (`s_name`), retrieve the supplier's name and their associated nation's name (`n_name`). Include all suppliers, even if their nation is somehow missing in the dataset.

```sql
SELECT s.s_name, n.n_name
FROM supplier AS s
LEFT JOIN nation AS n ON s.s_nationkey = n.n_nationkey;
```



### Exercise 4: Customers and Their Regions

**Task:** Display a list of all customers (`c_name`) and their associated regions (`r_name`). If a customer's region cannot be determined, still display the customer's name but indicate the region as 'Unknown'.

HINT: Check out COALESCE 

Example: Try and see what it does `COALESCE(r.r_name, 'Unknown') AS region_name `

```sql
SELECT c.c_name, COALESCE(r.r_name, 'Unknown') AS region_name
FROM customer AS c
LEFT JOIN nation AS n ON c.c_nationkey = n.n_nationkey
LEFT JOIN region AS r ON n.n_regionkey = r.r_regionkey;
```



### Exercise 5: Products and Their Orders

**Task:** Retrieve a list of products (`p_name`) and the number of times they've been ordered (`o_orderkey`). Include all products, even if they haven't been ordered, and display a count of 0 for those.



HINT: Check out COALESCE 

Example: Try and see what it does  `COALESCE(COUNT(l.l_orderkey), 0) AS order_count`

```sql
SELECT p.p_name, COALESCE(COUNT(l.l_orderkey), 0) AS order_count
FROM part AS p
LEFT JOIN lineitem AS l ON p.p_partkey = l.l_partkey
GROUP BY p.p_name;
```
