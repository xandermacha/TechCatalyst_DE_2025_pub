> Hints:

> Account Balance is `s_acctbal` from the `SUPPLIER` table 
>
> Market Segment is `c_mktsegment` from the `CUSTOMER` table

### Exercise 1 **Suppliers with High Account Balance**

- Write a SQL query to retrieve the top 5 suppliers who have the highest account balance. Include the supplier's name, nation, and account balance. Sort the results by account balance in descending order.

```sql
SELECT
    s.s_name AS supplier_name,
    n.n_name AS nation,
    s.s_acctbal AS account_balance
FROM
    SUPPLIER as s
JOIN
    NATION as n ON s.s_nationkey = n.n_nationkey
ORDER BY
    s.s_acctbal DESC
LIMIT
    5;
```



### Exercise 2 **Average Order Value by Year**

- Calculate the average order value for each year. Display the year and the corresponding average order value.

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_PART(YEAR, o.o_orderdate) AS year,
    AVG(o.o_totalprice) AS avg_order_value
FROM
    ORDERS as o
GROUP BY
    DATE_PART(YEAR, o.o_orderdate);

```



### Exercise 3 Total Revenue of Automobile Market Segment

* Find the total revenue generated from the 'AUTOMOBILE' market segment by Year.

```sql
SELECT
    YEAR(O.O_ORDERDATE) AS YEAR, 
    SUM(I.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1-I.L_DISCOUNT)) AS TOTAL_REVENUE
FROM LINEITEM AS I
JOIN ORDERS AS O ON O.O_ORDERKEY = I.L_ORDERKEY
JOIN CUSTOMER AS C ON O.O_CUSTKEY = C.C_CUSTKEY
WHERE
    C.C_MKTSEGMENT = 'AUTOMOBILE'
GROUP BY YEAR;
```



### Exercise 4 Best Nation

* Determine which nation has the most suppliers.

```sql
SELECT
    n.n_name AS nation,
    COUNT(s.s_suppkey) AS supplier_count
FROM
    NATION as n
JOIN
    SUPPLIER as s ON n.n_nationkey = s.s_nationkey
GROUP BY
    n.n_name
ORDER BY
    COUNT(s.s_suppkey) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```



### Exercise 5 Which Month?

* Find the month in which the highest number of orders were placed.

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_PART(MONTH, o.o_orderdate) AS month,
    COUNT(o.o_orderkey) AS order_count
FROM
    ORDERS as o
GROUP BY
    DATE_PART(MONTH, o.o_orderdate)
ORDER BY
    COUNT(o.o_orderkey) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```



### Exercise 6 Average Discount by Market Segment

* Calculate the average discount given on orders for each market segment.

```sql
SELECT
    c.c_mktsegment,
    AVG(l.l_discount) AS avg_discount
FROM
    CUSTOMER as c
JOIN
    ORDERS as o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
JOIN
    LINEITEM as l ON o.o_orderkey = l.l_orderkey
GROUP BY
    c.c_mktsegment;
```



### Exercise 7 Top 3 Nations

* Determine the top 3 nations that have the highest average account balances for their suppliers.

```sql
SELECT
    n.n_name AS nation,
    AVG(s.s_acctbal) AS avg_account_balance
FROM
    NATION as n
JOIN
    SUPPLIER as s ON n.n_nationkey = s.s_nationkey
GROUP BY
    n.n_name
ORDER BY
    AVG(s.s_acctbal) DESC
LIMIT 3;

```



# Challenge Activity

### Exercise: Identifying Customer Spending Behavior

#### Description

In this exercise, you will learn how to determine if a specific condition is met for any record in a related table using a case expression with a correlated subquery. The goal is to identify customers who have ever placed an order over $400,000. It doesn't matter how many such orders were placed; we only need to know if at least one exists.

#### Scenario

You are working with a retail database and want to classify customers based on their spending behavior. Specifically, you want to label customers who have placed any order over $400,000 as "Big Spender" and others as "Regular."

#### Task

Write an SQL query to find out if customers in a **specific range** have ever placed an order over $400,000. Use the `CASE`expression with a correlated subquery to achieve this.

For now, you can use the range of customers from 74000 to 74020

#### SQL Query Template

Here is the template of the SQL query you will be working with (fill in the blanks):

```sql
SELECT c_custkey, c_name,
       CASE
         WHEN EXISTS
          (SELECT 1 FROM orders o
           WHERE o.o_custkey = c.c_custkey
             AND o.o_totalprice > 400000) THEN 'Big Spender'
         ELSE 'Regular'
       END AS cust_type
FROM customer c
WHERE c_custkey BETWEEN 74000 AND 74020;

```

Second approach 

```sql
select  c.c_custkey
, c.c_name
,  CASE 
    when c.c_custkey in 
(select c.c_custkey
from customer as c
join orders as o on c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
where o.o_totalprice > 400000
) then 'Big Spender' 
else 'regular' end as cust_type
FROM CUSTOMER as c
WHERE c_custkey between 74000 and 74020;
```
