## 3.2.5

Using the `PART` Table we want to focus on two Brands (#11 and #42). 

* For Brand #11 if the size is less than or equal to 20 then it is a “High Cost Part”
* For Brand #11 if the size is greater than 20 then it is a “Low Cost Part”
* For Brand #42 if the size is less than or equal to 20 then it is a “High Demand Part”
* For Brand #42 if the size is greater than 20 then it is a “Low Demand Part”

The new column will be added is called `NOTE`

Example output:

```SQL
select  P_BRAND,P_TYPE, P_SIZE,
CASE 
    WHEN P_BRAND LIKE '%11' AND P_SIZE <= 20 THEN 'High Cost Part'
    WHEN P_BRAND LIKE '%11' AND P_SIZE > 20 THEN 'Low Cost Part'
    WHEN P_BRAND LIKE '%42' AND P_SIZE <= 20 THEN 'High Demand Part'
    WHEN P_BRAND LIKE '%42' AND P_SIZE > 20 THEN 'Low Demand Part'
    END as NOTE
from PART
WHERE P_BRAND LIKE '%11' OR P_BRAND LIKE '%42'
```
