### Exercise 1

Retrieve the `c_name` and `c_acctbal` (account balance) columns from the `Customer` table, but only for those rows in the `Machinery` segment (`c_mktsegment = 'MACHINERY'`) and with an account balance greater than `9998`.

```sql
select c_name, c_acctbal
       from customer
       where c_mktsegment = 'MACHINERY'
       and c_acctbal > 9998;
```



### Exercise 2

Retrieve the `c_name`, `c_mktsegment` (market segment), and `c_acctbal` (account balance) columns from the `Customer` table, but only for those rows in either the `Machinery` or `Furniture` market segments with an account balance between `â€“1` and `1`.

```sql
select c_name, c_mktsegment, c_acctbal
       from customer
       where c_mktsegment in ('MACHINERY','FURNITURE')
       and c_acctbal between -1 and 1;
```



### Exercise 3

Retrieve the `c_name`, `c_mktsegment` (market segment), and `c_acctbal` (account balance) columns from the `Customer` table, but only for those rows where *either* the market segment is `Machinery` and the account balance is `20`, *or* the market segment is `Furniture` and the account balance is `334`.

```sql
select c_name, c_mktsegment, c_acctbal
       from customer
       where (c_mktsegment = 'MACHINERY' and c_acctbal = 20)
         or (c_mktsegment = 'FURNITURE' and c_acctbal = 334);
```

### Exercise 4

Write a query to count the number of rows in the `Supplier` table, along with determining the minimum and maximum values of the `s_acctbal` column.

```sql
select count(*), min(s_acctbal), max(s_acctbal)
       from supplier;
```



### Exercise 5

Modify the query from Exercise 4  to perform the calculations, but for each value of `s_nationkey` rather than for the entire table.

```sql
select s_nationkey, 
         count(*), min(s_acctbal), max(s_acctbal)
       from supplier
       group by s_nationkey;
```

### Exercise 6

Modify the query from Exercise 5 to return only those rows with more than `300` suppliers per `s_nationkey` value.

```sql
select s_nationkey, 
         count(*), min(s_acctbal), max(s_acctbal)
       from supplier
       group by s_nationkey
       having count(*) > 300;
```
