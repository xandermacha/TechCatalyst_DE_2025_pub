## 3.2.7

The following query returns the number of suppliers in each region:

```sql
SELECT R_NAME, COUNT(*)
       FROM NATION N
       INNER JOIN REGION R ON R.R_REGIONKEY = N.N_REGIONKEY
       INNER JOIN SUPPLIER S ON S.S_NATIONKEY = N.N_NATIONKEY
       GROUP BY R_NAME;
```

Modify this query to use **case expressions** to pivot this data so that it looks as follows:

```sql
SELECT 
         SUM(CASE WHEN R_NAME = 'AMERICA' THEN 1 
                  ELSE 0 END) AS AMERICA,
         SUM(CASE WHEN R_NAME = 'AFRICA' THEN 1 
                  ELSE 0 END) AS AFRICA,
         SUM(CASE WHEN R_NAME = 'EUROPE' THEN 1 
                  ELSE 0 END) AS EUROPE,
         SUM(CASE WHEN R_NAME = 'MIDDLE EAST' THEN 1 
                  ELSE 0 END) AS MIDDLE_EAST,
         SUM(CASE WHEN R_NAME = 'ASIA' THEN 1 
                  ELSE 0 END) AS ASIA
       FROM NATION N
       INNER JOIN REGION R ON R.R_REGIONKEY = N.N_REGIONKEY
       INNER JOIN SUPPLIER S ON S.S_NATIONKEY = N.N_NATIONKEY ;
```
