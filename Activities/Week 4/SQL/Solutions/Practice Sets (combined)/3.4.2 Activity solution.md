## 3.4.3 Activity

As a data analyst for NorthWind Traders, you are asked to assist two distinct marketing teams. One team focuses on the "AUTOMOBILE" market segment, while the other focuses on the "BUILDING" market segment. Your task is to provide a consolidated list of all customers from both market segments without any duplicates. Customers may belong to multiple market segments over time, so you need to use `UNION` to ensure each customer appears only once in the result.

**Task**: Write an SQL query to achieve the following:

- Identify customers from the "AUTOMOBILE" market segment.
- Identify customers from the "BUILDING" market segment.
- Combine the results using `UNION` to remove duplicates.
- Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to structure your query.

**Hint**: Use CTEs to create separate lists of customers for each market segment, then combine these lists using `UNION`.



```sql
-- Step 1: Create a CTE for customers in the "AUTOMOBILE" market segment
WITH automobile_customers AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT c.c_custkey, c.c_name
    FROM customer AS c
    WHERE c.c_mktsegment = 'AUTOMOBILE'
),

-- Step 2: Create a CTE for customers in the "BUILDING" market segment
building_customers AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT c.c_custkey, c.c_name
    FROM customer AS c
    WHERE c.c_mktsegment = 'BUILDING'
)

-- Step 3: Combine the results from both CTEs using UNION
SELECT c_custkey, c_name, 'AUTO' as team
FROM automobile_customers
UNION
SELECT c_custkey, c_name, 'BUILD' as team
FROM building_customers
ORDER BY C_NAMe ASC;
```
