## 3.4.1 Activity 



**Exercise 1**

As a data analyst for NorthWind Traders, you are tasked with identifying the top 10 customers in terms of total sales. Additionally, you need to provide insights on the number of orders each of these top customers has made and calculate the average price per order. The average price per order is defined as the total order price divided by the total number of orders made by the customer.

**Task**: Write an SQL query to achieve the following:

- Identify the top 10 customers based on total sales.
- Show the number of orders made by each of these top 10 customers.
- Calculate the average price per order for each of these customers.

**Hint**: Use aggregation functions and consider using a common table expression (CTE) to structure your query effectively.



```sql
WITH customer_sales AS (
    SELECT c.c_custkey,
           c.c_name,
           COUNT(o.o_orderkey) AS num_orders,
           SUM(o.o_totalprice) AS total_sales
    FROM customer AS c
    JOIN orders AS o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
    GROUP BY c.c_custkey, c.c_name
)

SELECT cs.c_custkey,
       cs.c_name,
       cs.num_orders,
       cs.total_sales,
       cs.total_sales / cs.num_orders AS avg_order_price
FROM customer_sales AS cs
ORDER BY cs.total_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```





**Exercise 2**

* As a data analyst for NorthWind Traders, you are tasked with identifying the top-performing nations and their best-selling products. Your goal is to determine the top 5 nations by total order sales, broken down by market segment, and then find the top 3 selling products for these nations based on Sum Charge.
  
  **Task**: Write an SQL query to achieve the following:
  
  1. Identify the top 5 nations based on total order sales, broken down by market segment.
     - Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) to store these results.
  2. Using the CTE, find the top 15 selling products by Sum Charge for these top nations.
     - Sum Charge is defined as `Extended Price x (1 - Discount) x (1 + Tax)`.
  
  **Hint**: Use aggregation functions, JOINs, and consider using a Common Table Expression (CTE) to structure your query effectively.

```sql
WITH TOP_NATIONS AS
(SELECT N.N_NATIONKEY, N.N_NAME, SUM(O.O_TOTALPRICE) AS TOTAL_SALES
FROM ORDERS AS O
JOIN CUSTOMER AS C ON O.O_CUSTKEY = C.C_CUSTKEY
JOIN NATION AS N ON C.C_NATIONKEY = N.N_NATIONKEY
GROUP BY N.N_NATIONKEY, N.N_NAME
ORDER BY TOTAL_SALES DESC
LIMIT 5)


SELECT * FROM
(
SELECT  TP.N_NAME,
        P.P_NAME,
        SUM(L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1-L.L_DISCOUNT)*(1+L.L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE
FROM ORDERS AS O 
JOIN LINEITEM AS L ON O.O_ORDERKEY = L.L_ORDERKEY
JOIN PART AS P ON L.L_PARTKEY = P.P_PARTKEY
JOIN CUSTOMER AS C ON O.O_CUSTKEY = C.C_CUSTKEY
JOIN TOP_NATIONS AS TP ON C.C_NATIONKEY = TP.N_NATIONKEY
GROUP BY TP.N_NAME, 
         P.P_NAME
ORDER BY SUM_CHARGE DESC
LIMIT 15) AS FINAL

ORDER BY N_NAME;
 
```

OR

```sql
WITH TOP_NATIONS AS
(SELECT N.N_NATIONKEY, N.N_NAME, SUM(O.O_TOTALPRICE) AS TOTAL_SALES
FROM ORDERS AS O
JOIN CUSTOMER AS C ON O.O_CUSTKEY = C.C_CUSTKEY
JOIN NATION AS N ON C.C_NATIONKEY = N.N_NATIONKEY
GROUP BY N.N_NATIONKEY, N.N_NAME
ORDER BY TOTAL_SALES DESC
LIMIT 5),
FINAL AS
(
SELECT  TP.N_NAME,
        P.P_NAME,
        SUM(L.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1-L.L_DISCOUNT)*(1+L.L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE
FROM ORDERS AS O 
JOIN LINEITEM AS L ON O.O_ORDERKEY = L.L_ORDERKEY
JOIN PART AS P ON L.L_PARTKEY = P.P_PARTKEY
JOIN CUSTOMER AS C ON O.O_CUSTKEY = C.C_CUSTKEY
JOIN TOP_NATIONS AS TP ON C.C_NATIONKEY = TP.N_NATIONKEY
GROUP BY TP.N_NAME, 
         P.P_NAME
ORDER BY SUM_CHARGE DESC
LIMIT 15
)

SELECT * FROM FINAL ORDER BY N_NAME;
```



**Exercise 3**

**Common Table Expressions (CTE)**

* As a data analyst for NorthWind Traders, you are tasked with analyzing the sales performance of parts. Your goal is to identify the top 5 selling parts in 1997, broken down by month, and then determine the last time these parts were ordered.
  
  **Task**: Write an SQL query to achieve the following:
  
  1. Identify the top 5 selling parts in 1994
     - Top selling parts are based on `Sum Charge = Extended Price x (1 - Discount) x (1 + Tax)`.
     - These are parts that have been fulfilled (Line States is F) and not returned (Return Flag is A or N but not R)
     - Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) to store these results.
  2. Using the CTE, find the last order date for these top parts.
     - Use the Commit Date for determining the last order date.
  
  **Hint**: Use aggregation functions, JOINs, and consider using a Common Table Expression (CTE) to structure your query effectively.


```sql
WITH TOP_PRODUCTS AS 
(
SELECT P.P_NAME, 
       P.P_PARTKEY,YEAR(O.O_ORDERDATE) ,
       SUM(LI.L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1-LI.L_DISCOUNT)*(1+LI.L_TAX)) AS SUM_CHARGE,
FROM ORDERS AS O
JOIN LINEITEM AS LI ON O.O_ORDERKEY = LI.L_ORDERKEY
JOIN PART AS P ON LI.L_PARTKEY = P.P_PARTKEY
WHERE LI.L_RETURNFLAG <> 'R' 
        AND LI.L_LINESTATUS = 'F' 
        AND YEAR(O.O_ORDERDATE) = 1994
GROUP BY P.P_NAME,
         P.P_PARTKEY, YEAR(O.O_ORDERDATE) 
ORDER BY SUM_CHARGE DESC
LIMIT 5) 

SELECT T.P_NAME AS PRODUCT_NAME, MAX(L.L_COMMITDATE) AS MOST_RECENT_CDATE
FROM LINEITEM AS L
JOIN TOP_PRODUCTS T ON L.L_PARTKEY = T.P_PARTKEY
GROUP BY T.P_NAME;
```



**Exercise 4**

On average, how many days does it take on average to ship an order from the order date per month in 1994? 

```sql
SELECT MONTH(O.O_ORDERDATE) AS "MONTH",
      AVG(DATEDIFF('DAYS', O.O_ORDERDATE, L.L_SHIPDATE)) AS DAYS 
FROM ORDERS AS O 
JOIN LINEITEM AS L ON O.O_ORDERKEY = L.L_ORDERKEY
WHERE YEAR(O.O_ORDERDATE) = 1994
GROUP BY "MONTH"
ORDER BY "MONTH"
```





**Exercise 5**

As a data analyst for NorthWind Traders, you need to determine the efficiency of suppliers in shipping orders. Specifically, you want to find out the average number of days it takes for each supplier to ship an order from the commit date.

**Task**: Write an SQL query to achieve the following:

- For each supplier, calculate the average number of days it takes to ship an order from the commit date.

**Hint**: Use date functions and aggregation functions to calculate the average shipping time. You may need to join the `lineitem` and `supplier` tables to get the necessary information.



```sql
SELECT S.S_SUPPKEY,
       S.S_NAME,
       AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, L.L_COMMITDATE, L.L_SHIPDATE)) AS AVG_SHIPPING_DAYS
FROM LINEITEM AS L
JOIN SUPPLIER AS S ON L.L_SUPPKEY = S.S_SUPPKEY
GROUP BY S.S_SUPPKEY, S.S_NAME;
```
