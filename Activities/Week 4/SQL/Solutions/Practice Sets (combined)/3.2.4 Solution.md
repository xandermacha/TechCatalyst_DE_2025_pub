## 3.2.4 Activity



**Activity 1: List Customers and Their Total Orders**

- Write a SQL query to retrieve a list of customers along with the total number of orders they have placed. Include customer names and the corresponding order counts. Order the results by the customer's last name.



```sql
SELECT
    c.c_name,
    COUNT(o.o_orderkey) AS total_orders
FROM
    TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
JOIN
    TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
GROUP BY
    c.c_name
ORDER BY
    c.c_name;
```

**Activity 2: Find High-Value Customers**

- Create a SQL query to identify high-value customers who have placed orders with a total value greater than $10,000. List the customer name, their total order value, and the number of orders they've placed. Sort the results by the total order value in descending order.

```sql
SELECT
    c.c_name,
    SUM(o.o_totalprice) AS total_order_value,
    COUNT(o.o_orderkey) AS total_orders
FROM
    TPCH_SF1.CUSTOMER c
JOIN
    TPCH_SF1.ORDERS o ON c.c_custkey = o.o_custkey
GROUP BY
    c.c_name
HAVING
     SUM(o.o_totalprice) > 10000
ORDER BY
     SUM(o.o_totalprice) DESC;
```

**Activity 3: Identify Popular Parts**

- Write a SQL query to find the top 10 most popular parts (items) based on the total quantity ordered. Include the part name, part number, and the total quantity ordered for each part. Sort the results by the total quantity ordered in descending order.

```sql
SELECT
    p.p_name as part_name,
    p.p_partkey as part_number,
    sum(l.l_quantity) as total_qty_ordered
FROM
    LINEITEM as l
    JOIN PARTSUPP as ps ON l.l_partkey = ps.ps_partkey
    AND l.l_suppkey = ps.ps_suppkey
    JOIN PART as p ON ps.ps_partkey = p.p_partkey
GROUP BY
    part_name,
    part_number
ORDER BY
    total_qty_ordered DESC
LIMIT
    10;
```
