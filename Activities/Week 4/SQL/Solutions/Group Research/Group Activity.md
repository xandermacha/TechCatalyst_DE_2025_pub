# Snowflake Table Types and View Types: Summary Table

## Notes

- **Permanent, Transient, and Temporary tables** cover most needs; newer types (Dynamic, Hybrid, Iceberg) are more specialized
- **Views** enable abstraction and access control, while **materialized/dynamic tables** offer performance boosts at a storage/maintenance cost
- Syntax varies with typeâ€”use `CREATE [TYPE] TABLE/View` followed by column definitions or select queries as shown above.



| Type                      | What is it (Definition)                                      | Purpose                                                      | Key Difference                                               | Common Use Case                                          | Example Syntax                                          |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Permanent Table**       | Standard table for long-term storage.                        | Store persistent data that must be retained indefinitely.    | Supports Time Travel & Fail-Safe; persists until explicitly dropped. | Core business data; transactional history                | `CREATE TABLE my_table (id INT, name STRING);`          |
| **Transient Table**       | Table with shorter retention; no Fail-Safe.                  | Store data needed for a short period.                        | No Fail-Safe; lower storage costs; shorter data recovery window. | Staging, intermediate computations                       | `CREATE TRANSIENT TABLE temp_tbl (id INT);`             |
| **Temporary Table**       | Table alive only for session duration.                       | Store data that is session-specific or for quick jobs.       | Visible only to session; dropped at session end.             | ETL pipelines, temp aggregations during a session        | `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE session_tbl (id INT);`          |
| **External Table**        | Reference to data stored outside Snowflake (e.g., S3).       | Query external datasets without ingesting into SF.           | Points to external sources; does not store actual data in Snowflake. | Querying raw data in S3 or Blob Storage                  | `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ext_tbl ... LOCATION=@my_stage;` |
| **Hybrid Table**          | Snowflake-native transactional table for high-frequency inserts and fast queries. | Supports operational/analytical workloads.                   | Combines transactional and analytical performance.           | Event tracking, OLTP-like use cases                      | `CREATE HYBRID TABLE ...;`                              |
| **Iceberg Table**         | Table based on Apache Iceberg open files/table format.       | Analytics across cloud data lake & Snowflake.                | External table format interoperability; supports versioned data. | Data mesh, multi-engine lakehouse workloads              | `CREATE ICEBERG TABLE ...;`                             |
| **Dynamic Table**         | Automatically refreshed result of a query; like an auto-updating materialized view. | Maintain fresh query results with automatic background refresh. | Specified refresh criteria; result auto-maintained.          | Real-time dashboards, SCD, denormalized marts            | `CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE dyn_tbl AS SELECT ...;`           |
| **Materialized View**     | Precomputed, physical copy of a query result.                | Optimize/reduce compute for frequent, complex queries.       | Stores results; faster reads but may be stale until refreshed. | Aggregations, expensive query results cache              | `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mat_view AS SELECT ...;`      |
| **Non-Materialized View** | Virtual table; query executed on access, doesn't store results. | Simplify complex queries, provide abstraction/security.      | No data stored; always returns up-to-date data; may be slower for complex queries. | Mask columns; join/transform for BI; access restrictions | `CREATE VIEW my_view AS SELECT ...;`                    |
| **Secure View**           | Like a standard or materialized view, but with enhanced security & privacy for sensitive data. | Restrict who can view underlying data/view definition.       | Hides view definition from non-owners; enhanced data security. | Regulated data, PII, external data sharing               | `CREATE SECURE VIEW sec_view AS SELECT ...;`            |
