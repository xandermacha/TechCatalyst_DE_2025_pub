# Level of Detail

In this activity, you will practice creating LOD calculations.

## Instructions

**Part 1**

* With the `Global Superstore` Excel workbook, create a visualization of state-level profits, as in the following image, which visualizes the contribution of each state to the national profit.

**Part 2**

* In the next map, visualize each city's contribution toward the state's total profit, as in the following image:

  ![image-20240729194350289](images/image-20240729194350289.png)
  
  

**Part 3**

* Create a visualization of state-level profits, as in the following image:

  ![image-20240729194407840](images/image-20240729194407840.png)

* The label for each state is **not** the total sum of profits in that state. Rather, it is a state-level visualization of the average of the orders.

## Hint

* For this map, you will need to research Tableau LOD syntax. What will you use instead of `EXCLUDE`?
