# No Shows

You will now spend time creating a series of visualizations that provide insights into who is more or less likely to show up to a doctorâ€™s appointment.

## Instructions

* Create a line chart that compares the ages of patients against the total number of appointments. Then, split this graph based on Scholarship and whether the patient showed up to their appointment.




* For this first step, you'll need to convert `Age` from a Measure to a Dimension
