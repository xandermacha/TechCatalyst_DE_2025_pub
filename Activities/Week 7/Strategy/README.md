> 60 minutes

#### Background:

A retail company, *ShopTrend*, wants to optimize its marketing strategy by understanding its diverse customer base better. The company has a vast amount of customer data, including purchase history, browsing behavior, and customer feedback. However, this data is scattered across different systems and is not utilized effectively. ShopTrend wants to leverage this data to create targeted marketing campaigns, personalized content, and improve customer experience.

#### Objective:

Develop a data analytics solution that aggregates and analyzes customer data to create distinct customer segments. These segments will be used to tailor marketing strategies, ensuring they are relevant and effective for each customer group.

#### Key Requirements:

1. **Data Aggregation**: Combine customer data from various sources, including CRM systems, website analytics, and purchase history.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure the data is clean, consistent, and reliable.
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Utilize clustering algorithms to create customer segments based on purchasing behavior, feedback, and browsing history.
4. **Insight Generation**: Generate insights into the preferences and behaviors of each segment.
5. **Strategy Formulation**: Develop tailored marketing strategies for each segment.
6. **Monitoring & Optimization**: Implement a system to monitor the effectiveness of the targeted campaigns and optimize them over time.
