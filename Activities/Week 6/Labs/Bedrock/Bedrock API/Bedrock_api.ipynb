      "\n",
      "2. **Model Customization**:\n",
      "   - **Fine-Tuning**: Allows you to fine-tune foundation models on your own data to better suit your specific use cases.\n",
      "   - **Integration with AWS Services**: Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services like Amazon SageMaker for advanced machine learning workflows.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Security and Compliance**:\n",
      "   - **Data Protection**: Ensures data privacy and compliance with industry standards and regulations.\n",
      "   - **Access Control**: Provides robust access control mechanisms to manage who can access and use the models.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Model Evaluation**:\n",
      "   - **Performance Metrics**: Offers tools to evaluate the performance of your models, including accuracy, latency, and other relevant metrics.\n",
      "   - **A/B Testing**: Supports A/B testing to compare different versions of your models.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cost Management**:\n",
      "   - **Pay-As-You-Go**: You only pay for what you use, with no upfront costs or long-term commitments.\n",
      "   - **Cost Optimization**: Provides tools and recommendations to help you optimize your costs.\n",
