# Use Case: Real-Time Retail Analytics Platform

**Scenario**: A retail company wants to improve its understanding of customer behavior and satisfaction by analyzing various data sources. These sources include transcribed audio from customer service calls, customer feedback texts, and images collected from the feedback page. The company aims to extract valuable insights to enhance customer experience, streamline operations, and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.

**Requirements**:

1. **Data Sources**:
   - **POS Systems**: Real-time sales transactions from Point of Sale (POS) systems.
   - **E-commerce Platform**: Online sales data.
   - **Customer Loyalty Program**: Data on customer purchases, points, and rewards.
   - **Inventory Management System**: Stock levels, restocking events, and supplier information.
   - **Transcribed Audio**: Text transcriptions from customer service calls.
   - **Customer Feedback Text**: Textual feedback submitted by customers through various channels.
2. **Data Ingestion**:
   - **Real-Time Data**: Streaming data from POS systems and e-commerce platform.
   - **Batch Data**: Periodic data dumps from the customer loyalty program and inventory management system.
3. **Data Processing and Transformation**:
   - **Real-Time Processing**: Processing of streaming data for immediate insights.
   - **Batch Processing**: Aggregation and transformation of batch data for comprehensive analysis.
   - **Data Enrichment**: Adding contextual information to data (e.g., customer demographics, product categories).
4. **Data Storage**: (`HINT: reseach about HOT vs COLD storage`)
   - **Hot Storage**: For real-time data that needs quick access (e.g., in-memory databases like Redis or Apache Ignite).
   - **Cold Storage**: For historical data that can be accessed with some latency (e.g., AWS S3, Hadoop HDFS).
5. **Data Quality and Governance**:
   - **Data Quality Checks**: Validation, cleansing, and standardization of data.
   - **Metadata Management**: Tracking data lineage, definitions, and usage. 
6. **Data Security and Privacy**:
   - **Access Controls**: Role-based access controls to ensure data security.
   - **Data Encryption**: Encryption of data at rest and in transit.
   - **Compliance**: Adherence to relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
7. **Data Visualization and Reporting**:
   - **Real-Time Dashboards**: Interactive dashboards for monitoring sales, inventory levels, and customer behavior.
   - **Scheduled Reports**: Periodic reports for in-depth analysis.

#### Instructions 

**Step 1: Understand the Use Case**

- Review the detailed scenario and requirements for the retail analytics platform.
- Discuss the key objectives and outcomes desired by the retail company.
- Explore various AWS services that could be relevant to the use case, including but not limited to:
  - **Storage and Data Management**: S3, RDS, DynamoDB
  - **Data Processing**: Lambda, Glue, EMR
  - **AI/ML Services**: Rekognition, Textract, Comprehend, Translate, Macie, Bedrock
  - **Analytics and Visualization**: Athena, QuickSight, Redshift

**Step2 : Design the DataOps Pipeline Architecture**

- Draft an architecture diagram that includes the following components:
  - **Data Sources**: Identify and illustrate the different data sources (POS systems, e-commerce platform, customer loyalty program, inventory management system).
  - **Data Ingestion**: Show how data will be ingested (streaming for real-time data, batch for periodic data).
  - **Data Processing and Transformation**: Outline real-time and batch processing components, including any enrichment steps.
  - **Data Storage**: Specify hot and cold storage solutions and their integration.
  - **Data Quality and Governance**: Include components for data quality checks, metadata management, and governance practices.
  - **Data Security and Privacy**: Highlight measures for access control, data encryption, and compliance.
  - **Data Visualization and Reporting**: Show how data will be delivered to stakeholders via dashboards and reports.

**Step 3: Select Tools and Technologies**

- **DO RESEARCH: Client is open for commercial and/or open-source tools if they are suggested by you** 
  - Choose appropriate tools and technologies for each component of the pipeline. Consider using (the following are just examples):
    - **Data Ingestion**: Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, Apache NiFi.
    - **Real-Time Processing**: Apache Flink, Spark Streaming.
    - **Batch Processing**: Apache Spark, AWS Glue.
    - **Data Storage**: Redis, Apache Ignite (hot storage), AWS S3, Hadoop HDFS (cold storage).
    - **Data Quality**: Talend, Trifacta, Informatica.
    - **Metadata Management**: Apache Atlas, Alation.
    - **Data Security**: AWS IAM, Apache Ranger.
    - **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, Looker.

**Step 4: Present the Architecture**

**Your goal is to sell the client on the idea that YOU can do it (it is doable), and that the proposed solution has been well thought out**

- Each group will create a presentation covering their architecture diagram, tool selection, and how they addressed each requirement.

- Presentations should include:

  - A walkthrough of the architecture diagram.

  - Justification for tool and technology choices.

  - How the pipeline ensures data quality, governance, security, and privacy.

  - Explanation of how real-time and batch processing are handled.

  - Examples of real-time dashboards and reports (e.g. suggest topics/titles for such dashboards such as a customer analytics dashboard to do ABC, or an Inventory real-time dashboard/report for ABC ..etc) for stakeholders.
