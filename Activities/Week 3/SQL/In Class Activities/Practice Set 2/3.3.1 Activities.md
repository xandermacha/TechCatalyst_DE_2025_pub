## 3.3.1 Activities



### Exercise 1

Retrieve the `c_name` and `c_acctbal` (account balance) columns from the `Customer` table, but only for those rows in the `Machinery` segment (`c_mktsegment = 'MACHINERY'`) and with an account balance greater than `9998`.



### Exercise 2

Retrieve the `c_name`, `c_mktsegment` (market segment), and `c_acctbal` (account balance) columns from the `Customer` table, but only for those rows in either the `Machinery` or `Furniture` market segments with an account balance between `â€“1` and `1`.

### Exercise 3

Retrieve the `c_name`, `c_mktsegment` (market segment), and `c_acctbal` (account balance) columns from the `Customer` table, but only for those rows where *either* the market segment is `Machinery` and the account balance is `20`, *or* the market segment is `Furniture` and the account balance is `334`.

### Exercise 4

Write a query to count the number of rows in the `Supplier` table, along with determining the minimum and maximum values of the `s_acctbal` column.

### Exercise 5

Modify the query from Exercise 4  to perform the calculations, but for each value of `s_nationkey` rather than for the entire table.

### Exercise 6

Modify the query from Exercise 5 to return only those rows with more than `300` suppliers per `s_nationkey` value.
